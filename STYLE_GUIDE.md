# TASK REBEL BRAND & COPY STYLE GUIDE

## CORE IDENTITY
Task Rebel isn't just another productivity app. We're the angry, hilarious friend who pushes you to get your sh*t together while making you laugh about how much of a mess you are.

## VOICE PRINCIPLES

### 1. GLORIOUSLY UNFILTERED
We say what other productivity tools are too polite to say. We're not here to coddle users with corporate platitudes about "achieving their best selves." We're here to call them out on their procrastination in the most entertaining way possible.

### 2. UNEXPECTEDLY PHILOSOPHICAL
Like a Modest Mouse lyric that makes you go "wait, that's actually profound," we occasionally drop existential truth bombs between the jokes.

### 3. ABSURDLY SPECIFIC
We don't just make broad jokes; we dive into hyper-specific, oddly relatable scenarios that make users think "how did they know about my weird habit of reorganizing my sock drawer instead of finishing my taxes?"

### 4. CLEVERLY TANGENTIAL
We love a good tangent that somehow circles back to the point, Douglas Adams-style. Our copy might take unexpected detours but always lands somewhere meaningful.

## WRITING GUIDELINES

### DO:
- Use casual profanity strategically (not gratuitously)
- Create unexpected metaphors for productivity concepts
- Write in first person when appropriate ("We think your to-do list needs therapy")
- Embrace parenthetical asides (they're like bonus jokes)
- Call out procrastination tactics with brutal honesty

### DON'T:
- Use corporate jargon or buzzwords
- Rely on obvious jokes or tired productivity clichés
- Be mean-spirited or genuinely discouraging
- Overuse exclamation points!!!
- Write paragraphs longer than 3-4 sentences

## TONE EXAMPLES

### WELCOME MESSAGE
**Corporate Version:** "Welcome to Task Rebel! We're excited to help you achieve your productivity goals."

**Task Rebel Version:** "Well look who finally decided to get organized. Welcome to Task Rebel, where we'll help turn your chaotic pile of responsibilities into something resembling a functional adult life. (Results not guaranteed for people who think coffee is a personality trait.)"

### TASK COMPLETION
**Corporate Version:** "Congratulations on completing your task!"

**Task Rebel Version:** "Holy sh*t, you actually did it! Should we alert the local news? We had a whole speech prepared about your inability to finish things, and now we have to throw it out. Thanks a lot."

### MISSED DEADLINE
**Corporate Version:** "We noticed you missed a deadline. Would you like to reschedule?"

**Task Rebel Version:** "That deadline whooshed by like a taxi you desperately tried to flag down in the rain. Was it realistic, or were you just lying to yourself again? Either way, let's pretend this was all part of your master plan and reschedule it. Tomorrow? Next century? Your call."

### EMPTY TASK LIST
**Corporate Version:** "Your task list is empty. Add some tasks to get started."

**Task Rebel Version:** "Your task list is emptier than a philosophy major's bank account. Either you're suspiciously productive or you're avoiding reality by not writing anything down. We're betting on the latter. Add a task, you magnificent avoider of responsibility."

### FEATURE EXPLANATION (PRIORITY LEVELS)
**Corporate Version:** "Set task priorities from high to low to organize your workflow."

**Task Rebel Version:** "Our priority levels range from 'Actual Emergency' to 'Who Are You Kidding, You're Watching Netflix Tonight.' Be honest with yourself—that's allegedly what therapy is for."

## HEADLINE FORMULAS

1. **The Truth Bomb:** "The To-Do List: Where Good Intentions Go to Die Until Now"

2. **The Absurd Comparison:** "Organizing Tasks Like a Squirrel with a LinkedIn Account"

3. **The Unexpected Question:** "What If Your Calendar Actually Respected Your Time?"

4. **The Self-Aware Pitch:** "Another Productivity App? No, Wait, We Can Explain..."

5. **The Existential One-Liner:** "Remember When You Thought You'd Have Your Life Together by Now?"

## UI COPY GUIDELINES

### BUTTONS & ACTIONS
- Use active, rebellious verbs
- Keep it short but impactful
- Examples:
  - "Launch Mission" (not "Create Task")
  - "Crush It" (not "Complete")
  - "Abort Mission" (not "Delete")
  - "Infiltrate" (not "Sign In")
  - "Join the Rebellion" (not "Sign Up")

### ERROR MESSAGES
- Always maintain humor, even in failure
- Provide clear solutions while being entertaining
- Examples:
  - "The server is having an existential crisis. Have you tried telling it that it matters?"
  - "404: This page has gone rogue. Probably starting its own productivity app."
  - "Your password is weaker than your morning coffee. Add some special characters to spice things up."

### EMPTY STATES
- Turn void into opportunity
- Make users laugh at their procrastination
- Examples:
  - "This category is as empty as your promises to start working out."
  - "No analytics yet. We can't analyze what you haven't done (subtle hint)."
  - "Your mission log is cleaner than your room. Time to mess it up with some tasks."

### LOADING STATES
- Make waiting time entertaining
- Use thematic references
- Examples:
  - "Recruiting rebels..."
  - "Plotting revolution..."
  - "Hacking the mainframe... (just kidding, almost done)"

Remember: Task Rebel isn't just helping users manage tasks—we're acknowledging the universal human experience of trying to function in a world that constantly demands more than we can give, and we're laughing about it together. Like a Mitch Hedberg joke, we find the humor in everyday absurdities while creating a weirdly effective productivity tool.
